          <div>
            From a very young age, I have been fascinated by computers. My first experience with a personal computer came when my aunt let me play on an old Windows xp 
            computer. I was probably 5 at the time and struggled with the coordination required to operate a mouse. After some time, I was able to adjust and some of my 
            favorite pass times came from playing with MS Paint. Once I got a computer in my home equipped with dial-up, I began getting curious about how these machines 
            worked and stumbled upon the world of batch programming. I had a friend at the time that shared the same curiosity, and we would share text games we would make 
            with this interpreter-based scripting language. After a few years, and an upgrade to our network from dial-up, I began to write music using a program called 
            Musescore. Music was another fascination of mine and I was and am good at it. <br /><br />
            When it came time to pick a major in college, I was torn between picking Physics or Music as a major but ultimately settled into music as my skills afforded me 
            the opportunity to have my music degree paid for with scholarships. I established myself as a leader in many ensembles and even branched out from my primary 
            instrument (the horn) to singing. In my community, I sang in a choir at St. Mathew Catholic Church and played horn with the Monroe Symphony Orchestra. When I 
            graduated with my Music Degree in 2019, I maintained my positions in these ensembles while holding a job in fast food at Sonic and later moving to an 
            assistant-manager position at Shoe Department. In 2020, I was released from my singing position at St Mathew due to the global pandemic, and the Monroe Symphony 
            orchestra canceled all concerts for the season. I was left with only my assistant manager position at Shoe department, but after some time I had to leave this 
            position due to a family health crisis. At this point, I was left thinking about what I should do next. I rediscovered my love of computers and learned a great 
            amount about hardware and what goes into building a computer. I even built my own computer at this time. I also started researching what it would take to reenroll 
            in a computer science program at my Alma Mater. <br /><br />
            In January of 2021, I began my studies. I dedicated myself wholeheartedly to learning everything I could while enrolled in this program. In my time spent studying,
            I participated in programing contests and even placed first in my division, melded my passion for music by revisiting my favorite music writing program at the 
            time and creating an xml encoder in java, and participated in a group tasked with building a web application for our school. Now that I have graduated with my 
            degree in computer science, I wish to use my skills to build websites that provide an even platform for all voices. I support the ethical use of AI, and the fair
            exchange of information by all individuals.
